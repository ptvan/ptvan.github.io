I started doing photography in highschool informally, learning B&W darkroom techniques, Ansel Adams' zone technique, etc.

## MUSICA

In college I was introduced to a short-lived Seattle-based music newspaper where I photographed concerts, music festivals and club openings.

## Self-published photobooks

After that I photographed regularly when I traveled, and also did shoots of friends occasionally.
