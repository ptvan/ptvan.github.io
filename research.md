# A brief summary

I'm currently working as an analyst at [Fred Hutch](http://rglab.org), specializing in high-dimensional flow cytometry and RNASeq. I received my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon](https://cmu.edu/bio) where I designed and built a patented fluorescence imager to detect low-abundance proteins. Before grad school I worked on gene transcription networks and proteomics at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://baliga.systemsbiology.net/). 

My greatest strength is adaptability: I have had success as [field ecologist](https://www.fs.usda.gov/colville), [photojournalist](https://makingtheprince.blogspot.com/2013/11/meet-author.html), bioengineer and data scientist . I am motivated and organized, having worked 3 jobs simultaneously through college and self-published an illustrated children's book through KickStarter in graduate school. 

I enjoy explaining and applying complex ideas. I lectured introductory biology to 200 students and mentored 3 undergraduate teams during my PhD, and am currently collaborating with a diverse international team of researchers. Outside my research day job, I'm a strong advocate for science literacy, mentoring students from elementary school through PhD, and curating an open [wiki of data science best practices](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org).

# Published projects in reverse chronological order

### openCyto & ggCyto (Van & Jiang et al, 2018)
As a postdoc, I helped extend [OpenCyto](http://opencyto.org), an open-source R software framework for gating high-dimensional flow-cytometry and mass-cytometry data. I also worked on [ggCyto](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223365/), an R package that enables ggplot-style plotting of flow- and mass-cytometry datasets.

### Structured Illumination Gel Imager (SIGI) (Van et al, 2014)
As part of my PhD thesis, I built a protein [imager](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935033) using structured illumination to increase dynamic range in order to detect rare protein in complex mixtures of cell extracts. Carnegie Mellon was granted a US [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10362237B2/) on this work after I graduated.

### Archeal oxidative stress response network (Kaur et al, 2007)
Working at the Institute for Systems Biology as a research associate, I worked on an extended version of [Inferelator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16686963), an R algorithm for predicting regulators of gene expression. This branch of the algorithm ended up being superseded, but you can see a version of code I worked on in this Github [repository](https://github.com/ptvan/inferelator-ancient). This work enabled us to build and test a model of [oxidative stress response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1987344/) in an extremophilic archaeon.

### Halobacterium PeptideAtlas (Van et al, 2008)
As an intern working at ISB, I converted peptide mass spectra from vendor-specific binary formats into mzXML, mapped spectra to peptides then loaded the proteins into SQLServer-backed web [portal](https://peptideatlas.org). We also found biases in peptide detection depending on [the method used](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643335/).

### Nutria spread in Seattle (Van & Tkaczyk et al, 2007)
As University of Washington undergrads, my good friend Filip and I collected sightings of [nutria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coypu) (Myocastor coypus) in western Washington, mainly in areas surrounding Union Bay. I ran a linear model to predict the spread of the species in Seattle using R and ArcGIS. This ended up informing a decision by the UW's Environmental Health and Safety not to undertake eradication efforts, since much of the population was not surviving through the winters anyway.
