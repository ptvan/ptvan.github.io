Hello there ! You can see some of the things I do above: 
- The About page has my CV, research interests and portfolio of past projects.
- The Courtyard Kitchen is a companion blog to the print cookbook I published. 
- The Prince is an illustrated fable for children that I published via KickStarter.
- Writings include the novel that I'm writing at a glacial pace, and some essays.
