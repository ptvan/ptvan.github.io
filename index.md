Hi, I'm an analyst specializing in big data, currently working in high-dimensional flow cytometry and RNASeq at Fred Hutch, where I design and deploy software in research settings. I received my PhD at CarnegieMellon where I designed and built a patented fluorescence imager to detect rare proteins. Before grad school I authored multiple papers on gene transcription networks and proteomics at the Institute for Systems Biology. 

You can see some of the things I do above: 
- The Courtyard Kitchen is a companion blog to the print cookbook I published. 
- The Prince is an illustrated fable for children that I published via KickStarter.
- Writings include the novel that I'm writing at a glacial pace, and some essays.
