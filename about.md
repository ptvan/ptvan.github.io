I'm an analyst specializing in big data, currently working in high-dimensional flow cytometry and RNASeq at Fred Hutch, where I design and deploy software in research settings and lead a team of analysts. I received my PhD at CarnegieMellon where I designed and built a patented fluorescence imager to detect rare proteins. Before grad school I authored multiple papers on gene transcription networks and proteomics at the Institute for Systems Biology. 

My greatest strength is adaptability: I enjoy mastering new skills and creating actionable plans quickly, and I have had success as field ecologist, photojournalist, bioengineer, data scientist and publisher. I am motivated and organized, having worked 3 jobs simultaneously through college and self-published an illustrated children's book through KickStarter in graduate school. 

I enjoy explaining complex ideas and inspiring teammates through example. I lectured introductory biology to 200 students and mentored 3 undergraduate teams during my PhD, and am currently collaborating with a diverse international team of researchers. Outside my research day job, I'm a strong advocate for science literacy, mentoring students from elementary school through PhD, and curating an open wiki of data science best practices.
