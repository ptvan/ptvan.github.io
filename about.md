## A brief summary

I'm an analyst specializing in big data, currently working in high-dimensional flow cytometry and RNASeq at [Fred Hutch](https://rglab.org), where I design and deploy software in research settings. I received my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon](https://cmu.edu/bio) where I designed and built a patented fluorescence imager to detect rare proteins. Before grad school I worked on gene transcription networks and proteomics at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://baliga.systemsbiology.net/). 

## Project portfolio

### openCyto & ggCyto
I helped extend [OpenCyto](https://opencyto.org), an open-source R software framework for gating high-dimensional flow-cytometry and mass-cytometry data

### Structured Illumination Gel Imager (SIGI)
I built a prototype protein imager using a scientific-grade CCD camera with structured illumination from an auditorium-grade projector. 

### Halobacterium PeptideAtlas 
I converted peptide mass spectra from vendor-specific binary formats into mzXML, mapped spectra to peptides then loaded the proteins into SQLServer-backed web portal. 

### Inferelator 2.0
I worked on a refined version of [Inferelator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16686963), an R algorithm for predicting genetic regulators of gene expression. 

### Nutria spread in Seattle
I ran a linear model to predict the spread of nutria (myocastor coypus) in Seattle using R and ArcGIS.
