## A brief summary

I'm an analyst specializing in big data, currently working in high-dimensional flow cytometry and RNASeq at [Fred Hutch](https://rglab.org), where I design and deploy software in research settings. I received my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon](https://cmu.edu/bio) where I designed and built a patented fluorescence imager to detect rare proteins. Before grad school I worked on gene transcription networks and proteomics at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.org).
