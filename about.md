# A brief summary

I'm an analyst specializing in big data, currently working in high-dimensional flow cytometry and RNASeq at [Fred Hutch](https://rglab.org). I received my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon](https://cmu.edu/bio) where I designed and built a patented fluorescence imager to detect rare proteins. Before grad school I worked on gene transcription networks and proteomics at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://baliga.systemsbiology.net/). 

# Project portfolio

### openCyto & ggCyto
I helped extend [OpenCyto](http://opencyto.org), an open-source R software framework for gating high-dimensional flow-cytometry and mass-cytometry data. I also worked on [ggCyto](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223365/), an R package that enables ggplot-style plotting of flow- and mass-cytometry datasets.

### Structured Illumination Gel Imager (SIGI)
As part of my PhD thesis, I built a protein [imager](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935033) using a scientific-grade CCD camera with structured illumination from an auditorium-grade projector, which was granted a US [patent](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/10362237.html) after I graduated.

### Halobacterium PeptideAtlas 
I converted peptide mass spectra from vendor-specific binary formats into mzXML, mapped spectra to peptides then loaded the proteins into SQLServer-backed web [portal](https://peptideatlas.org). We also found biases in peptide detection depending on [the method used](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643335/). 

### Inferelator 2.0
I worked on a refined version of [Inferelator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16686963), an R algorithm for predicting genetic regulators of gene expression. This work ended up being superseded, but you can see an ancient version of the code that I actually worked on in this Github [repository](https://github.com/ptvan/inferelator-ancient).

### Nutria spread in Seattle
My research partner and good friend and I collected sightings of [nutria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coypu) (Myocastor coypus) in western Washington, mainly in areas surrounding Union Bay. I ran a linear model to predict the spread of the species in Seattle using R and ArcGIS. This ended up informing a decision by the University of Washington's Environmental Health and Safety not to undertake eradication efforts, since much of the population was not surviving through the winters anyway.
