Hi, this is my webpage. You can see some of the things I do above: 

My CV includes the usual academic/professional information you expect.

The Courtyard Kitchen is a companion blog to the print cookbook I published. 

The Prince is an illustrated fable for children that I published via KickStarter.

Writings include the novel that I'm writing at a glacial pace, and some essays.
