In prediction and forecasting, the interpretability of the model is often as important as accuracy or recall. This is where decision trees often have an advantage, despite their age, since they're readily interpretable.

### Extensions to tree-based methods

Starting with the basic regression or classification trees (usually referred together as Classification and Regression Tree, or CART), developments include boosted trees, bagged trees (of which [random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) is one example). [CHAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_automatic_interaction_detection) (Chi-square automatic interaction detection) is a decision tree incorporating Bonferroni correction for significance testing.
