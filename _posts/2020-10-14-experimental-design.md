title: The design of experiments
---

Having worked at the wet bench, I had my fair share of experimental design. Though I have to admit having controls for a PCR or a set of protein gels is a far cry from designing a complex multi-site or longitudinal study.

### Why experiments

### Choosing your variables

### Confounding

### Statistical power

### References

There are plenty of books on experimental design.
