title: The design of experiments
---

Having worked at both the wet bench and in field ecology, I had my fair share of experimental design. Though I have to admit having controls for a PCR or picking field sites is a far cry from designing a complex multi-site vaccine trial or longitudinal studies.

### Why experiments

### Choosing your variables

### Replication, real or pseudo

Replication is central to reproducible research. Bench experiments should have both biological and technical replicates, while only the latter is possible for entirely _in silico_ experiments.

The lack of replication is often associated with failed experiments, and when coupled with intent, constitutes scientific fraud.

### Confounding

### Statistical power

### References

There are plenty of books on experimental design. On the short side, [Experimental Design for Biologists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4280443/), which covers reagents and choice of model organisms.
