title: Business strategy books

This post is a natural complement to my [post about management](https://ptvan.github.io/management-books-and-workshops/). Where people management is concerned with _micro_ effects, strategy is concerned with _macro_ effects, though the two are often intertwined in interesting ways. Below are my thoughts on some business strategy books that I have read.

### Good to Great (2001)

This was mentioned during one of our strategy sessions. I liked the systematic, data-driven approach the authors used to analyze how companies transition from Good to Great.

Some trends they observed in companies that transition from Good to Great are:

- External celebrity CEOs are negatively correlated with company success, while CEOs that were promoted from within were postively correlated with success.

- CEO compensation has no correlation with company success.

- Having a well-defined strategy does not guarantee success.

- Technology _accelerated_ success rather than igniting it.

- Mergers and acquisitions do not guarantee success, merging two mediocre companies results in a larger mediocre company.

- Good-to-great companies are spread across both high-growth and stagnant industries.
