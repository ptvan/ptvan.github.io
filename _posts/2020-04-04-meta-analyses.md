While meta analyses have been around for a long time (eg. the [Cochrane Reviews](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/)), the growth of open data initiatives have made it easier to perform data-integration and meta analyses in your favorite languages.

The `metafor` package is well-known and [well-documented](http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/help).

### Meta-analyses in Python

`PyMeta` is an [online tool](http://www.pymeta.com/), which has a pip package counterpart called [PythonMeta](https://pypi.org/project/PythonMeta/).
