Every grad student has to supervise younger students at some point in their career, and my experience managing 3 teams of undergrads were some of the highlights of my PhD experience. It was a relatively low-risk, informal introduction to management, I [learned a lot](https://medium.com/@nulzilla/10-pieces-of-advice-i-would-give-my-20-year-old-past-self-971017e0f5d) and I wanted more. After some more informal mentoring experiences at [FredHutch](https://fredhutch.org), I was a formal manager at my [next job](https://twinstrandbio.com), below are notes on some books I have read on management.

### The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (1989)

This is the book many people think of when you talk about management, though it has definitely been superseded by more modern, more domain-specific books since then. The habits of the title, like "seek to first to understand, then to be understood" and "be proactive" are high-level and uncontroversial, the former particularly resonated with me since I'm of the opinion that managing people is ultimately about relationships. I also learned the [Eisenhower matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method), a helpful tool in time management and prioritization. 

### The Making of A Manager (2019)

This book was recommended to me during the New Manager Bootcamp at TwinStrand, appropriately, since the author became a manager when Facebook was a startup like I was at TwinStrand. The book provides some good first questions to ask your team to set expectations both for when you're inheriting an existing team, or starting a new one. Some things I highlighted in this book are paraphrased below:

- If your report feels that your respect are based only on their performance, they will struggle to be honest when things are rocky. If instead they feel you care about them as individuals, you will get honesty in return.

- One-on-one meetings can be a little awkward, but that's OK since it means important things are being discussed and problems are addressed.

- Avoid "brilliant jerks", it's always possible to find people who are both smart and kind. Tolerating jerks sets predisposes your team to toxicity.

- If a team member is a poor fit despite your effort and theirs to make things work, let them go (first elsewhere in the organization, then departing) rather have them stay too long.

- Be prompt and specific when sharing feedback, provide examples and solutions. Confirm takeaways at the end to make sure there is no misunderstanding.
