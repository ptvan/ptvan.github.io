title: Visualizing Co-authorship networks
---

My labmate Ju was working on a visualization showing the co-authorship at FredHutch, which inspired me to use [igraph](https://igraph.org/r/) and [REntrez](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rentrez/index.html to visualize my much more modest publication
network. 

There are many ways to visualize these types of data. The [code](https://github.com/ptvan/R-snippets/blob/master/coauthor_network.R) I wrote was intended to show the different research circles I was apart of over the years.
