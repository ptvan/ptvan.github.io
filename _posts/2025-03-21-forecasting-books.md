title: Books on forecasting

Prediction and forecasting have always been interesting to me, both as personal intellectual curiosity, and a professional concern for a data analyst. Below are the notes I took for two books on the subject: Nate Silver's _The Signal and The Noise_ and Tetlock's _Superforecasting_ as I read them. 

### The Signal and The Noise (2012)

Nate Silver is known, among other things, for his work in forecasting elections through the now-defunct [FiveThirtyEight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight) website.

- The difficulty of assessing aggregate risk of bundled mortgage-backed financial assets precipitated the 2018 financial crises since these assets' market performance were often dependent on each other. Credit rating agencies used house prices going back 2 decades to assess their assets' risk. However, house prices 1980s - 2000s were always stable or increasing, precluding the possibility of small declines, let alone crashes. This is an example of a _out-of-sample_ problem.

- Political forecasters in the US are often fixated on broad stereotypes of what kinds of voters each of the two parties attract, rather than drawing on issue-specific polling to dissect smaller trends that sometimes run counter to overall ideology. To me, Silver seems to endorse a Bayesian approach of continually collecting information about the data, and updating inferences accordingly. FiveThirtyEight operate via three principles: think probablistically, good predictions change and look for consensus


### Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction (2016)

Compared to The Signal and The Noise, Superforecasting is written in a more academic style.  Interestingly, Nate Silver had met Tetlock and devoted a section in his book in The Signal and The Noise to discuss Tetlock and his ideas.
