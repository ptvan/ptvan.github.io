title: Workflow managers for bioinformatic pipelines
---

Due partly to the growth of datasets, and partly to the [replication crisis in science](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201218), workflow managers have been growing in popularity for bioinformatics. At FredHutch where I work, the two most common workflow managers are [Nextflow and Cromwell](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/software_overview/#workflow-managers). [Snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake) is also popular though I don't have much personal experience with it.

### NextFlow
In some ways, [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/) is the most portable. You download the Nextflow executable, call it on a script and off you go !
