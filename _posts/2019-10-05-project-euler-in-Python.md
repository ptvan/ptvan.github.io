title: Project Euler in Python
---

Now that I've done a few Project Euler in R, it's time to reimpliment them in Python. I'm looking forward to seeing the subtle (and not so subtle) ways the two languages (and libraries) differ. I like R but always found its [TIMTOWTDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it) approach to be be wildering at times (eg. do we really need [3 different object systems](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html) ?)

You can see the results in this GitHub repository: [euler-r](https://github.com/ptvan/euler-python).
