title: Building Graphical User Interfaces for Python code
---

When working in R, my work mostly involved reproducible analyses, and consisted mostly of scripts. For the occasional interactive report, [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) works well for creating graphical interfaces that can be made into stand-alone applications. For building GUIs in Python, there are multiple options

### tkinter

### Qt

### wxpython
