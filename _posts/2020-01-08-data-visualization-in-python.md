title: Data Visualization in Python

### It's good to be polyglot

Since I have done quite a bit of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis over the years, it's worth discussing tools Python has for these tasks. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is Python folks' answer to the R [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), in the sense that both attempt to streamline common data structures and functions for interactive data analysis. But as they say, the devil is in the details.

Where the tidyverse comes with its own visualization library, the well-known [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package, Python folks are blessed and cursed with options: the old-school [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), the new-school [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), the web-oriented [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest), as well as a [Python version of ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/).
