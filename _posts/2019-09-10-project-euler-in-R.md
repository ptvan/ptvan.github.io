title: Project Euler in R
---

I thought it would be fun to test my R skills by doing [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Modern programming languages have rather full-featured libraries, but it's still nice to learn (or re-learn) things from first principles, or see what others come up with. You can see the results in this GitHub repository: [euler-r](https://github.com/ptvan/euler-r).
