title: Being productive in Scala

A long time ago, when the Earth's crust had just cooled, I learned Java. Some years later, my best friend told me about [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), a functional language that compiles to the JVM. The idea was intriguing to me, but at that point, I felt it was maybe a little niche (my friend had pitched Clojure as a language to do massively parallel simulations). Since then, other languages targeting the JVM had popped up. I re-entered the fray with Scala.
