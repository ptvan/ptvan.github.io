title: Linear models
---

Linear models have been around for a long time, and despite the press given to more modern methods, they remain relevant. The principle behind them is easy to understand, though once you look at them rigorously there are a lot to consider. This simplicity means they can also be extended and built upon for new data types and applications.

### A little history

Least squares linear regression have been known to [Legrendre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre) and [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss).

### Basic formulation

### Model diagnostics

Linear models make certain assumptions, which are worth checking before relying on their results.

### Extensions to the linear model

### Implementations

Thanks to its roots as a statistical programming language, R has particularly strong support of linear models, with `stats::lm()` normally built as part of a core installation.

### References

There are plenty of books on linear models, though I find [Linear Models with R](https://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/LMR/index.html) and [Extending the Linear Model with R](https://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/ELM/index.html) from Julian Faraway particularly helpful.
