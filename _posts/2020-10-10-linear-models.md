title: Linear models
---

Linear models have been around for a long time, and despite the press given to more modern methods, they remain powerful.

### A little history

Least squares linear regression have been known to [Legrendre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre) and [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss).

### Basic formulation

### Model diagnostics

Linear models make certain assumptions, which are worth checking before relying on their results. 

### Extensions to the linear model

### Implementations

### References

There are plenty of books on linear models, though I find [Linear Models with R](https://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/LMR/index.html) and [Extending the Linear Model with R](https://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/ELM/index.html) from Julian Faraway particularly helpful.
