Hello there ! You can see some of the things I do above: 
<br>- The Research page has my CV and portfolio of past projects.
<br>- The Courtyard Kitchen is a companion blog to the print cookbook I self-published.
<br>- The Prince is an illustrated children's fable that I published via KickStarter.
<br>- Writings include essays and a fictional novel I'm writing at a glacial pace.

Below you can see my blog posts in reverse chrological order:

<div class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <article class="post">

      <h1><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        {{ post.excerpt }}
      </div>

      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}" class="read-more">Read More</a>
    </article>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
